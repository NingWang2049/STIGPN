### Prepare Data
1. Follow [here](https://github.com/praneeth11009/LIGHTEN-Learning-Interactions-with-Graphs-and-Hierarchical-TEmporal-Networks-for-HOI) to prepare the original data of CAD120 dataset in `CAD120/datasets` folder.
2. You can also download the data we have processed directly from [here]{https://pan.baidu.com/s/1uRP7GCBBL5Eb0Fi7c362oA}.
3. We also provide some checkpoints to the trained models. Download them [here]{https://pan.baidu.com/s/1uRP7GCBBL5Eb0Fi7c362oA} and put them in the checkpoints folder
4. extraction code: 1rly
